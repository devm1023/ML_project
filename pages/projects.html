<p><b><u>Loan Defaulter Prediction</u></b></p>
<p>Prediction of loan defaulter based on training set of more than 5L records using Python, Numpy, Pandas and XGBoost</p>

<p><i>Hacker Exeprience</i></p>
<p>The problem was hosted for <A href="https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/machine-learning/bank-fears-loanliness/" target="_blank">Machine Learning Challenge on Hacker Earth</A>. You can download the dataset from the challenge page or from the direct link to the same dataset <A href="https://he-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/media/hackathon/machine-learning-challenge-one/bank-fears-loanliness/898ce544-0-MLChallenge_1Datac63af4e.zip" target="_blank">here</A>.</p>

<p>The code achieves about 97.6% accuracy in predictions. My best submission stood 15th on the leaderboard. Finished 19th though, which was scored on a less accurate submission. There were > 200 participants with over 90% accuracy.</p>
