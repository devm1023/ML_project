# Loan Defaulter Prediction
Prediction of loan defaulter based on training set of more than 5L records using Python, Numpy, Pandas and XGBoost

## Hacker Exeprience
The problem was hosted for [Machine Learning Challenge on Hacker Earth](https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/machine-learning/bank-fears-loanliness/). You can download the dataset from the challenge page or from the direct link to the same dataset [here](https://he-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/media/hackathon/machine-learning-challenge-one/bank-fears-loanliness/898ce544-0-MLChallenge_1Datac63af4e.zip)

The code achieves about 97.6% accuracy in predictions. My best submission stood 15th on the leaderboard. Finished 19th though, which was scored on a less accurate submission. There were > 200 participants with over 90% accuracy.
