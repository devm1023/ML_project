			<h5>Welcome to my data science blog!</h5>
			<p style="text-align:justify">
				I'm Abhijit Annaldas. I've been working as Software Engineer since close to 5 years. Recently in Aug 2016, I fell in serious love with Data Science. Since then my signinficant time out of work is being spent on pursuing this new found passion. Since the academics/subjects I have been through didn't give me enough exposure to mathematics, grasping machine learning was initially tough for me. In this blog I intend to share my journey. Believe me, getting started wasn't easy. I had a zillion questions as to where to begin, what all the basics are required. The depth and vastness of the subject is mind-boggling. And for one like me without enough mathematics exposure initially, it was difficult to find the starting point.

			<p style="text-align:justify">
				I will share how I overcame the initial difficulties and how I'm learning a subject (Data Science) that needs expertise from different subjects like mathematics, statistics, machine learning and programming. There are different approaches to learn Data Science in my opinion. I'll give a brief intro about each of those and the approach I'm taking, and why I do so. Will share my data science learnings from time to time. It could be mathematics, statistics, machine learning or any other related concept. I'll keep this blog dedicated to Data Science realm only.
