		<h3>Welcome to my data science blog!</h3>
		<p>I'm Abhijit Annaldas, a Software Engineer with over 5 years of extensive experience in building enterprise scale applications spanning a wide variety of domains and underlying technology stack, including Microsoft and open source technologies. I started getting familiar with Machine Learning in early 2016<sup><A href="#a" title="When I came across an ML solution to diagnose diabetic retinopathy, I was blown away, and fell in love with ML. Someday, I wish to contribute to health sector to improve disease diagnosis, prevention, drug discovery, etc., something on those lines.">(?)</A></sup> which soon turned into a my labor of love. I spend considerable amount of my free time learning Machine Learning, when am not busy with my day job. Since the academics/subjects I have been through didn't give me enough exposure to mathematics, grasping machine learning was initially tough for me. Believe me, getting started wasn't easy. I had a zillion questions as to where to begin, what all the basics are required. The depth and  vastness of the subject is mind-boggling. And for one like me without enough mathematics exposure initially, it was difficult to find the starting point. Before I started this journey, I hated mathematics and now I love it. I have learned more mathematics since early 2016 than what I had learned in my formal education. In this blog, I intend to share my learnings and experiences.</p>
		<p>If you think I can be of any help or if you have any questions/thoughts, please do not hesitate to drop me a note at avannaldas at hotmail dot com. I would love to hear from you, even if it's just a hello! Amazing things happen when like minds come together.</p>
