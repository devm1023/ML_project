title:  "Building a Data Science Portfolio"

Having a good portfolio is very important to an individual's success. It brings opportunities, helps get in touch with great people. Networking/new connections can bring in lot of mutual learning. People with like mindset, those who have worked on similar problems will get in touch. It's a win-win for everyone.

GitHub is no doubt a nerds portfolio! I would recommend doing lots-n-lots of hands on projects and push them to the GitHub. If it's beginner level, having different kinds of projects/datasets/problems helps in maximizing learning. If it's in the intermediate/expert level or about specialization, doing a lot of different kind of projects related to the specialization under consideration helps strengthen skills.

Some tips for good presentation of repositories (portfolio)...
* Each project should have a different repository (needless to say, but I've seen people stuffing code into same repo with a blanket name)
* A neat and short 'read me' for each repository explaining a problem statement and the solution in short, preferably a single page at max.
* Apart from code and introductory read me, document the solution approach in detail. The purpose of this would be to show how the solution was built. It should include...
    - Problem Statement
    - Info about dataset
    - Visualizations of data
    - train, cross validation, test and predict performance charts
    - accuracy, metrics and results
    - end notes: challenges faced, possible enhancements, etc.
* If code uses a jupyter notebook, code and the solution approach detail can be neatly presented together.
* Last but not the least, keep sharing your knowledge through a github.io blog (as I'm doing!)

All the best!
