title:  "Machine Learning - Beyond the buzz!"

I have been listening to people discussing/gossiping about Machine Learning since long time. I was in one of such conversations today, where rest of the people were trying to wrap their heads around the topic. I was explaining them what is Machine Learning in as simple way as I could. I see a trend in what most of the people think what Machine Learning is all about. The field has created a lot of buzz around the world and is one of the hottest of all disciplines these days. Here I'll share my understanding of the field and what would it take to make a career in Machine Learning/Data Science. I am hoping that this can be of little help in taking the important decision about the career.

Everyone has their own understanding and views about the field. Some of the popular thoughts people hold in mind are...

* Data Scientists earn a lot
* It is a bright career option as it is just picking up and isn't going to be out of scene anytime soon (maybe in terms of employment opportunities)
* Everyone is talking about it, if I don't learn it I'll be soon irrelevant/unemployable
* Computers are soon gonna do all the jobs humans do today
* Many of my friends/acquaintances are learning it, am I falling behind and why can't I do it?

While there is some truth in these thoughts, such impulsive thoughts/talk of the town shouldn't be a trigger to choose Machine Learning as a career option. The buzz and the glamour that pulls one into the field soon fades away as soon as he/she gets the feet wet in Machine Learning. I'll mention a Hindi quote that used to be circulated as a meme (with a weird/angry face image) among engineering students. No offence to anyone please. I just can't resist bringing that up here - _Kisne bola tha re engineering me bahut scope hai?_ Which roughly translates to the thought that means _I got into engineering due to the hype and it isn't interesting anymore_. If you can relate to that, read that replacing engineering with Machine Learning. Machine Learning is in a similar situation I think.

If you wanna get into Machine Learning, you should have a strong objective/goal that Machine Learning will help you achieve. Choosing/making a career in Machine Learning shouldn't be the objective in itself. The reason should not be money, fame, etc., but a problem that you believe you can solve using Machine Learning.

I first heard about Machine Learning 3 years ago and I didn't see any compelling reason at that point of time to seriously consider the field. In early 2016, I came to know about something which forever changed what Machine Learning means to me. I read about diagnosing diabetic retinopathy from retina images using Machine Learning. That was a wow moment for me. I saw immense potential of doing great work, positively impacting people's lives which is visible first hand, so direct and close from the work I can do. The mere thought that Machine Learning cuts across multiple fields, disciplines and different walks of life is fascinating to me. That's when I became serious about Machine Learning. 

Once you have a solid reason, goal and a story, below is a short one liner depiction of the path to Machine Learning mastery you need to take. Though you may take shortcuts from time to time, every shortcut will have it's own cost which you'll have to either pay by taking a break, coming back to learning or in terms of inefficiencies and imperfections in your expertise. Honestly, I'm yet to complete my first iteration of the loop even after 18 months.

  > Linear Algebra -> Calculus -> Probability -> Statistics -> Statistical Learning Theory -> Optimization Techniques -> Machine Learning/Deep Learning -> Programming Language -> Data Preprocessing, Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis -> Mastering Machine Learning/Deep Learning libraries/frameworks -> relentless practice -> keeping up with the advancements -> loop back to the topic that you realize you need to revisit.

If you are at a juncture where you are thinking of career options, here's my advice. Assess yourself, you are the best person to evaluate for yourself what you can do. You don't have to go by the hype and ride the same wave everyone is. You can achieve mastery, do great work, make a lasting impact on the world, be proud of yourself and make your loved ones proud of you in any field. It need not be Machine Learning (or any hottest happening). Find something you can devote your rest of the life to. And give yourself all into it. And I'm sure wonders will happen. Some of the fields that I think are going to be big...
  * Clean Energy - Global warming, depleting fossil fuels, increasing energy needs and a lot of other problems have one common solution - clean energy.
  * Quantum Computing - Once this is a reality, everything is gonna change. All the equations of the (tech) life we take for granted today will be turned upside down. 
  * Health, Fitness, Diet and Nutrition - This will only become more and more important day by day.
  * Agricultural Advancements - with changing weather, water and ecological landscape, it's important to evolve techniques of agriculture.
