<to do: tone down to mean mastering the basics is not the only way, one could do with min required mathematics and pursue ML, it’s about choice/way of learning>

I’ve just started looking into Machine Learning. I am not saying that I’ve started learning it because when I was going through the first lesson, I stumbled upon mathematical expressions that I’ve never seen before! And that’s where I took a U turn to first learn the required Mathematics before I get back to Machine Learning. I hated mathematics so much in my school that I didn’t study it after my Junior College. Well, just kidding, my career path is a little strange… I didn’t elect Mathematics for different reasons, not that I hate it that much :)

So yes, back to Machine Learning. Machine Learning is heavily mathematical in nature. And, I wasn’t surprised about this. Learning Machine Learning without strong mathematics fundamentals could be tricky affair and often will lead to shallow knowledge.

And for someone like me who has studied very little mathematics, it’s better to go over mathematics first. As I started digging through Mathematics, questions like where to start? what to learn? in what sequence? started popping up in my head. It took me a few days to figure out what all Mathematics needs to be studied for Machine Learning.

Well, we are lucky we have numerous structured online learning resources, open-sourced learning content (like MIT Open Courseware and many more) today.

But my baby steps towards Machine Learning started with a simple Google search for “Mathematics for Machine Learning“.. and there you go see Internet getting everything you need on to your plate. The only thing is you need to ask the right questions.

Here is a quick checklist of the topics you need to learn in Mathematics in that order before you get into Machine Learning…

    Vectors
    Matrices
    Calculus Basics
    Algebra Basics
    Linear Algebra

Since it took me a few days to understand all about this when I started looking into Machine Learning, I hope this helps you have a good head start. Please do share your inputs about your learning stories, because human learning is all about sharing and helping each other!
